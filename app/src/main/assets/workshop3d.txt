Workshop on 3D printing

Target Participants: Semesters 2, 4, 6 of Mechanical Engineering.

Description: 
3D printing refers to processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together. 3D printing is used in both rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing (AM). Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF).
