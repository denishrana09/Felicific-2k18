Phase 1: Basics
 
In this phase we will teach basics of Arduino, Servo Motor and Sonic Sensor. Participants will be able to make blink and serial data communication. At the end of this phase, therell be a quiz and an assignment code to be designed by participants.

Time Duration: 50 Minutes.

Phase 2: Implementation of Radar 

In This Round Students will implement the circuit. Then well teach the logic of Arduino code for the radar.

Time Duration: 70 Minutes.

Java code for the processing software will be illustrated to student. Required material (soft copies, datasheets, demo codes etc.) will be provided. 

Rules:
1.	Students must bring one laptop and one Arduino Board (any).
