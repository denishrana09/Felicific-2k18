Simulation Contest (MATLAB, Verilog, Microcontroller)


Description: There are 3 tracks of simulation included:
1.	MATLAB (Communication/Microwave& Antenna/Image Processing)
2.	Verilog (Digital Logic implementation using Quartus)
3.	Microcontroller (Assembly)

Participants can take part in any one of the following tracks based on their skills.

Team size: 2 members only

Expected strength/skill of participants: Participants should have knowledge of MATLAB, Proteus for 8051 Microcontroller Simulation and Quartus for Verilog HDL.

Registration fees per team: Rs. 50 per Team

Name of Student Co-ordinator(s):
Pratik Gupta (7990617385), Aashlesh Parekh, Devansh Thakkar, Kartik Shah	.

Rounds scheme
Round 1: Debugging

1.	Each participant is required to solve errors in given code within 30 minutes.

Time Duration: 30 minutes

Round 2: Simulation

1.	Participants will have to simulate given problem with desired result within 1 Hour. If none of the participants are able to obtain the output, the winner will be declared on the basis of correctness of the algorithm implemented.

Time Duration: 1 Hour

Round 3: (For Microcontroller Track only):

Sample program is required to modify to meet the given functionality. 

Rules:
1.	Hard copy of book is allowed for technical help.
2.	Instruction set for 8051 MCU will be provided for reference.
3.	Each round is an elimination round, qualifying participants will get into next round.
4.	Coordinators decision will be final in any dispute.
